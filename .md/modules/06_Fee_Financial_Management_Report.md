## ABSTRACT

The Fee & Financial Management System is a critical module of the Academic Monitoring System for Students, designed to manage student fees collection, payment processing, receipts, financial records, and accounting. This module streamlines financial operations, ensures transparency, and provides comprehensive financial reporting.

The primary objective is to automate fee collection, payment processing, receipt generation, and financial tracking. The system tracks payment status, manages fee reminders, handles fee waivers and concessions, and generates financial reports for institutional planning and accounting.

The proposed system addresses challenges in manual fee management including manual receipt writing, difficulty in tracking payments, delayed financial reporting, and lack of transparent fee information to students. Key features include fee structure definition, payment processing, receipt generation, payment history tracking, and financial analytics. This report details the technical design, implementation approach, testing methodology, and future enhancements for the Fee & Financial Management System.

## CHAPTER 7: TESTING

### 7.1 Introduction to System Testing

System testing verifies:

1. Payments recorded correctly
2. Receipts generated accurately
3. Fee status updated properly
4. Financial records maintained
5. Payment reminders sent appropriately
6. Reporting shows correct balances

### 7.2 Types of Testing

#### Unit Testing
- Test payment amount validation
- Test receipt number generation
- Test fee status transitions
- Test financial record calculation

#### Integration Testing
- Payment entry → Receipt generation → Email sending
- Payment recording → Fee status update → Student balance update
- Multiple payments → Total balance calculation

#### Functional Testing
- Student pays partial fee
- Student pays multiple fees simultaneously
- View payment history
- Generate financial report
- Export fee data

#### White Box Testing
- Verify receipt number generation is unique
- Test transaction rollback on email failure
- Verify financial record entries match payments

#### Black Box Testing
- User records payment → Receipt generated and emailed
- User views fee status → Shows accurate balance
- Finance staff generates report → Report totals correct

#### Security Testing
- Student cannot modify payment amount
- Non-finance staff cannot void payments
- Payment amounts limited to fee outstanding
- Email verification of receipts

#### Performance Testing
- Process payments for 1000+ students
- Generate receipts in bulk
- Send reminders to 500+ students
- Generate monthly financial reports
