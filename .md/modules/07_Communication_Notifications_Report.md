## ABSTRACT

The Communication & Notifications System is an essential module of the Academic Monitoring System for Students, designed to facilitate systematic communication between institutional administrators, faculty, parents, and students. This module provides multiple channels for announcements, alerts, and important institutional information dissemination.

The primary objective is to ensure timely and reliable delivery of important information to relevant stakeholders. The system supports notifications via email, SMS, in-app alerts, and push notifications, enabling administrators to reach students and parents effectively with academic announcements, policy updates, and important alerts.

The proposed system addresses challenges in manual communication including delayed information dissemination, inconsistent message delivery, difficulty in targeting specific recipient groups, and lack of delivery confirmation. Key features include announcement posting, targeted notifications, multi-channel delivery, read status tracking, and message templates. This report details the technical design, implementation approach, testing methodology, and future enhancements for the Communication & Notifications System.

## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Objective

The Communication & Notifications System is developed with the following objectives:

1. **Timely Information Dissemination**: To ensure quick delivery of important institutional information to students, faculty, and parents.

2. **Targeted Communication**: To send relevant information to specific groups (programs, batches, departments) minimizing irrelevant notifications.

3. **Multi-Channel Delivery**: To support email, SMS, and in-app notifications ensuring message reach through preferred channels.

4. **Message Persistence**: To maintain communication history and enable archival of important announcements.

5. **Delivery Confirmation**: To track message delivery and read status for accountability and follow-up.

### 1.2 Scope of the Project

The Communication & Notifications System covers:

**Functional Scope:**
- Announcement posting by administrators
- Notification scheduling and delivery
- Multi-channel delivery (Email, SMS, In-app)
- Recipient targeting and segmentation
- Message templates for common communications
- Delivery tracking and status monitoring
- Read status tracking
- Notification history and archival
- User preferences for notification settings

**Geographic Scope:**
- Institutional-wide communications
- Department-specific announcements
- Program and batch-specific messages
- Individual student/parent notifications

**Time Scope:**
- Real-time notification delivery
- Scheduled notifications for future delivery
- Historical message retention
- Recurring notifications (semester-wise)

**Technical Scope:**
- Web-based interface for message creation
- Automated notification queue processing
- Integration with email and SMS gateways

## CHAPTER 3: ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Existing System

Challenges in manual communication:

1. **Information Silos**: Important information stuck with:
   - Faculty personal emails
   - Department notice boards
   - Word-of-mouth communication
   - No centralized repository

2. **Delayed Dissemination**: Manual communication causes:
   - Delays in reaching all stakeholders
   - Missing some intended recipients
   - No confirmation of message receipt

3. **No Record Keeping**: Important announcements:
   - Not archived for reference
   - Lost after removal from notice board
   - No historical tracking

### 3.2 Proposed System

Automated communication with:

1. **Centralized Platform**: All announcements in single system accessible anytime.

2. **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Reach students and parents via email, SMS, and app.

3. **Targeted Messaging**: Send relevant messages to specific groups based on program, batch, status.

4. **Delivery Tracking**: Confirm message delivery and track read status.

### 3.3 Feasibility System

#### Economic Feasibility
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduced printing and manual distribution costs.
- **Efficiency**: Administrators spend less time on communication.
- **Gateway Costs**: SMS gateway costs offset by delayed printing costs.
- **Verdict**: **FEASIBLE**

#### Technical Feasibility
- **Technology**: SMTP and SMS APIs readily integrated with PHP.
- **Background Processing**: Available through cron jobs or queue systems.
- **Verdict**: **FEASIBLE**

#### Operational Feasibility
- **Training**: Administrators easily learn system.
- **Adoption**: Students prefer digital notifications.
- **Verdict**: **FEASIBLE**

### 3.4 Software Specification

#### HTML5
- Announcement creation forms
- Notification scheduling interface
- Message template designer
- Recipient selection interface

#### CSS3
- Responsive notification pages
- Color-coding for message priority
- Print-friendly announcement layouts
- Mobile-optimized notification display

#### JavaScript
- Rich text editor for announcements

## CHAPTER 4: SYSTEM DESIGN

### 4.1 Table Design

The Communication & Notifications module utilizes the following table from the core database:

#### Table 1: `communications`
| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| id | int(11) | Primary Key, Auto Increment |
| sender_id | int(11) | Reference to the user who sent the message |
| sender_type | varchar(50) | Role of the sender (admin, faculty) |
| title | varchar(255) | Subject or title of the communication |
| message | text | Content of the message |
| message_type | enum | notice, alert, email, sms |
| priority | enum | high, normal, low |
| target_type | varchar(50) | Targeted group (all, student, batch) |
| target_id | int(11) | ID of the target group if applicable |
| is_published | tinyint(1) | Whether the message is visible to users |
| published_at | timestamp | Date and time of publication |
| created_at | timestamp | Record creation timestamp |

### 4.2 Flowchart

[Placeholder: Provide flowchart showing: administrator creates announcement → selects recipients → chooses delivery channels → schedules delivery → system processes queue → sends via email/SMS → updates delivery status → tracks read status.]

### 4.3 Data Flow Diagram

[Placeholder: Provide DFD showing flow from announcement creation through recipient selection, delivery processing, and read status tracking with gateway integrations.]

### 4.4 E-R Diagram

## CHAPTER 7: TESTING

### 7.1 Introduction to System Testing

System testing verifies:

1. Announcements created and stored correctly
2. Notifications delivered via selected channels
3. Recipients properly selected based on filters
4. Delivery status tracked accurately
5. Read status updated when users view messages
6. Template variables replaced correctly

### 7.2 Types of Testing

#### Unit Testing
- Test recipient selection filters (by program, batch, status)
- Test template variable substitution
- Test priority-based notification ordering
- Test schedule date validation

#### Integration Testing
- Create announcement → Queue notification → Send email → Track delivery
- SMS delivery → Update delivery status → Read receipt
- Email bounce → Retry mechanism → Failed status

#### Functional Testing
- Create announcement for all students
- Schedule notification for future date
- Send SMS to specific batch
- View delivery status dashboard
- Mark message as read

#### White Box Testing
- Verify recipient query returns correct students
- Test queue processor handles concurrent deliveries
- Test error handling for email delivery failures
- Verify database constraints prevent invalid data

#### Black Box Testing
- Admin creates announcement → Appears in student inbox
- Student reads message → Read status updated
- Scheduled notification → Sends at scheduled time
- SMS delivery → Recipient receives message

#### Security Testing
- Non-admin cannot create announcements
- Student cannot access admin announcement area
- Email addresses cannot be harvested
- Notifications delivered only to intended recipients

#### Performance Testing
- Send notification to 5000+ students
- Process 1000+ delivery attempts simultaneously
- Generate delivery status report for 10000+ messages
- Template processing for 500+ variables
