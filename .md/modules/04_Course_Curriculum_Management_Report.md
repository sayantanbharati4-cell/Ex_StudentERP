## ABSTRACT

The Course & Curriculum Management System is a foundational module of the Academic Monitoring System for Students, designed to manage academic programs, courses, curricula, and their associations with students, faculty, and resources. This module provides administrators with tools to design, implement, and maintain institutional academic structures and ensure alignment with accreditation standards and learning objectives.

The primary objective of this system is to centralize curriculum management, automate course scheduling, link students to appropriate courses, and provide faculty with course information. The system facilitates curriculum versioning, allows tracking of course prerequisites and co-requisites, and enables analysis of curriculum effectiveness.

The proposed system addresses challenges in manual curriculum management such as scheduling conflicts, incorrect course-student associations, difficulty in curriculum updates, and lack of curriculum alignment tracking. Key features include program management, course creation and management, curriculum design, prerequisite tracking, and course allocation. This report details the technical design, implementation approach, testing methodology, and future enhancements for the Course & Curriculum Management System.

## CHAPTER 6: SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

### Program and Course Management (PHP)

**create_program.php:**
```php
<?php
session_start();
require_once 'config/config.php';

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $program_name = trim($_POST['program_name'] ?? '');
    $program_code = trim($_POST['program_code'] ?? '');
    $duration_years = intval($_POST['duration_years'] ?? 0);
    $total_credits = intval($_POST['total_credits'] ?? 0);
    $description = trim($_POST['description'] ?? '');
    
    // Validate
    if (!$program_name || !$program_code || !$duration_years || !$total_credits) {
        $_SESSION['error'] = 'All required fields must be filled';
        header('Location: program_create.php');
        exit();
    }
    
    try {
        $sql = "INSERT INTO programs 
                (program_name, program_code, duration_years, total_credits, description) 
                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
        
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare($sql);
        
        if ($stmt->execute([$program_name, $program_code, $duration_years, $total_credits, $description])) {
            $_SESSION['success'] = 'Program created successfully';
            header('Location: programs.php');
        } else {
            $_SESSION['error'] = 'Failed to create program';
        }
    } catch (PDOException $e) {
        if ($e->getCode() == '23000') { // Duplicate entry
            $_SESSION['error'] = 'Program code or name already exists';
        } else {

        }
    }
    
    header('Location: program_create.php');
    exit();
}
?>
```

### Curriculum Design Form

**HTML:**
```html
<form id="curriculumForm" method="POST" action="save_curriculum.php">
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="programSelect">Select Program</label>
        <select id="programSelect" name="program_id" class="form-control" 
                required onchange="updateCurriculumDisplay()">
            <option value="">-- Select --</option>
        </select>
    </div>

    <div id="semesters">
        <!-- Semesters will be generated dynamically -->
    </div>

    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Save Curriculum</button>
</form>

<script>
function updateCurriculumDisplay() {
    const programId = document.getElementById('programSelect').value;
    if (!programId) return;
    
    fetch('ajax/get_program_structure.php?program_id=' + programId)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            let html = '';
            for (let sem = 1; sem <= data.duration_years * 2; sem++) {
                html += `
                    <div class="semester-panel">
                        <h5>Semester ${sem}</h5>
                        <div class="course-selector">
                            <select multiple name="courses[${sem}][]" class="form-control">
                            </select>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                `;
            }
            document.getElementById('semesters').innerHTML = html;
        });
}
</script>
```

### Prerequisite Validation

```php
public function validatePrerequisites($student_id, $course_id, $pdo) {
    // Get prerequisites for course
    $sql = "SELECT p.prerequisite_id_ref, p.min_grade 
            FROM prerequisites p 
            WHERE p.course_id = ?";
    
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare($sql);
    $stmt->execute([$course_id]);
    $prerequisites = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    
    foreach ($prerequisites as $prereq) {
        // Check if student has completed prerequisite
        $checkSql = "SELECT g.grade_points, g.letter_grade 
                     FROM grades g 
                     WHERE g.student_id = ? 
                     AND g.subject_id = ? 
                     AND g.status = 'Passed'";
        
        $checkStmt = $pdo->prepare($checkSql);
        $checkStmt->execute([$student_id, $prereq['prerequisite_id_ref']]);
        $result = $checkStmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
        
        if (!$result) {
            return false; // Prerequisite not completed
        }
        
        // Check minimum grade if specified
        if ($prereq['min_grade']) {
            $gradeValue = $this->getGradeValue($result['letter_grade']);
            $minValue = $this->getGradeValue($prereq['min_grade']);
            
            if ($gradeValue < $minValue) {
                return false; // Grade below minimum
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true; // All prerequisites met
}
```

## CHAPTER 7: TESTING

### 7.1 Introduction to System Testing

System testing verifies:

1. Programs created with correct structure
2. Courses linked correctly to curriculum
3. Prerequisites enforced during enrollment
4. Schedule generation produces conflict-free timetables
5. Curriculum versioning maintains history
6. Student-course associations correct

### 7.2 Types of Testing

#### Unit Testing
- Test program duration validation
- Test credit calculation
- Test prerequisite checking logic
- Test curriculum version management

#### Integration Testing
- Program creation → Curriculum assignment → Course enrollment
- Prerequisite checking → Student enrollment blocking
- Schedule generation → Room/faculty conflict detection

#### Functional Testing
- Create program with 8 semesters
- Add 40 courses to curriculum with prerequisites
- Block student from course due to failed prerequisite
- Generate conflict-free timetable for 500 students

#### White Box Testing
- Verify prerequisite algorithm handles all edge cases
- Test database constraints prevent invalid curriculum states
- Test transaction rollback if schedule has conflicts

#### Black Box Testing
- User creates program → Program visible in list
- User assigns courses to semester → Curriculum saved
- User enrolls student → System validates prerequisites
- User generates schedule → No conflicts produced

#### Security Testing
- Non-admins cannot modify curriculum
- Faculty cannot change course schedules
- Student prerequisites enforced before enrollment

#### Performance Testing
- Generate timetable for 1000+ students
- Load curriculum with 100+ courses
- Handle 50+ concurrent curriculum edits
