### MySQL Query Example (StudentModel)

```php
public function addStudent($studentData) {
    $sql = "INSERT INTO students (registration_no, first_name, last_name, email, 
            phone, date_of_birth, gender, address, city, state, postal_code, 
            admission_date, status) 
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
    
    $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare($sql);
    
    return $stmt->execute([
        $studentData['registration_no'],
        $studentData['first_name'],
        $studentData['last_name'],
        $studentData['email'],
        $studentData['phone'],
        $studentData['date_of_birth'],
        $studentData['gender'],
        $studentData['address'],
        $studentData['city'],
        $studentData['state'],
        $studentData['postal_code'],

## CHAPTER 7: TESTING

### 7.1 Introduction to System Testing

System testing is a critical phase in software development where the complete integrated system is tested to verify that it meets the specified requirements. For the Student Information Management System, testing ensures that:

1. All modules integrate correctly with each other
2. Data flows properly through the system
3. User interfaces are responsive and intuitive
4. Database operations maintain integrity and consistency
5. Security measures are effective and protecting sensitive student data
6. Performance meets acceptable standards for concurrent users

The testing approach for SIM includes both manual and automated testing, covering functionality, usability, security, and performance aspects.

### 7.2 Types of Testing

#### Unit Testing
Tests individual components or functions in isolation:
- Test student validation functions (email format, phone digits, name characters)
- Test database query functions for retrieving student records
- Test ID generation and uniqueness
- Example: Testing the `generateRegistrationNumber()` function produces valid, unique numbers

#### Integration Testing
Tests how different modules work together:
- Student registration form → Database insertion → Confirmation email
- Student enrollment → Update in dashboard → Attendance module integration
- Emergency contact updates → Reflected in reports
- Document upload → Verification workflow

#### Functional Testing
Verifies that all features work as specified:
- Student can successfully register with valid data
- Validation errors shown for invalid email/phone format
- Duplicate registration prevented
- Search functionality returns correct results
- Edit/delete operations work properly
- Export to CSV generates correct data

#### White Box Testing
Tests internal code logic and paths:
- SQL injection prevention through prepared statements
- Session management and authentication flow
- Condition testing (status transitions: Active → Inactive → Graduated)
- Loop testing in bulk operations (importing multiple students)
- Error handling and exception management

#### Black Box Testing
Tests functionality without knowing internal code:
- User submits registration form with valid data → Student created successfully
- User searches for student by name → Correct results displayed
- User attempts SQL injection in search field → System handles safely
- User logs out → Cannot access restricted areas
- User uploads valid/invalid document → Appropriate response

#### Security Testing
- Test password validation rules
- Test access control (non-admins cannot delete students)
- Test input validation against XSS/SQL injection attacks
- Test session timeout and authentication enforcement
- Test file upload validation

#### Performance Testing
- Test system response time with 1000+ student records
- Test concurrent user access
- Test database query optimization
- Test page load times
- Test bulk operations (import 500 students)
