## ABSTRACT

The Library Management System is a comprehensive module of the Academic Monitoring System for Students, designed to manage library operations including book inventory, student borrowing, returns, fines, and reservations. This module facilitates efficient library resource management and improves student access to learning materials.

The primary objective is to replace manual card-based library management with a digital system that tracks book inventory, manages student borrowing transactions, enforces borrowing policies, and generates library usage statistics. The system improves library service efficiency and provides students convenient access to book information and borrowing status.

The proposed system addresses challenges in manual library management including inaccurate inventory tracking, slow borrowing/return processing, difficulty in enforcing return deadlines, and lack of borrowing history. Key features include book catalog management, student borrowing/return processing, fine calculation, book reservation, and library usage analytics. This report details the technical design, implementation approach, testing methodology, and future enhancements for the Library Management System.

## CHAPTER 3: ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Existing System

Challenges in manual library management:

1. **Card-Based Catalog**: Physical card system with:
   - Time-consuming manual searches
   - Difficult to find books quickly
   - High risk of lost or damaged cards
   - No availability information

2. **Manual Borrowing**: Paper-based transactions cause:
   - Slow borrowing/return process
   - Difficulty tracking overdue books
   - Manual fine calculation errors
   - No borrowing history available

### 3.2 Proposed System

Automated library management with:

1. **Digital Book Catalog**: Quick searchable database of all books and copies.

2. **Barcode System**: Fast borrowing/return through barcode scanning.

3. **Automatic Fine Calculation**: System calculates fines without manual intervention.

4. **Overdue Tracking**: Automatic identification and reminders for overdue books.

5. **Usage Analytics**: Reports on book popularity and borrowing trends.

### 3.3 Feasibility System

#### Economic Feasibility
- **Cost Reduction**: Eliminates manual catalog maintenance and staff overtime.
- **Efficiency**: Faster transactions reduce librarian time per borrowing.
- **Equipment Cost**: Barcode scanner and printer offset by labor savings.

## CHAPTER 7: TESTING

### 7.1 Introduction to System Testing

System testing verifies:

1. Books added to catalog correctly
2. Individual copies tracked with barcodes
3. Borrowing limits enforced
4. Overdue books identified correctly
5. Fines calculated accurately
6. Fine payments update status
7. Book availability updated properly

### 7.2 Types of Testing

#### Unit Testing
- Test borrowing limit enforcement
- Test fine calculation formula
- Test barcode uniqueness
- Test due date calculation

#### Integration Testing
- Book addition → Copy creation → Catalog appearance
- Borrowing → Copy status update → Availability change
- Return → Fine calculation → Student notification

#### Functional Testing
- Student borrows book with barcode
- System prevents borrowing over limit
- Student returns book
- Fine calculated for overdue book
- Student pays fine online

#### White Box Testing
- Verify borrowing policy enforces all business rules
- Test fine calculation for multiple overdue scenarios
- Test transaction rollback on copy update failure

#### Black Box Testing
- User scans barcode → Book borrowed successfully
- User returns book → Fine created if overdue
- Student views borrowing history → Shows correct details

#### Security Testing
- Student cannot override borrowing limits
- Non-librarians cannot modify fines
- Barcode checking prevents invalid entries
- Date calculations audited

#### Performance Testing
- Search through 10000+ book catalog
- Scan and borrow 500+ book copies
- Calculate fines for 5000+ overdue books
- Generate library usage reports
