## ABSTRACT

The Examination Management System is a comprehensive module of the Academic Monitoring System for Students, designed to manage all aspects of the examination process including exam scheduling, question paper generation, seat allocation, result processing, and availability. This module streamlines examination administration and provides transparency to students and stakeholders.

The primary objective is to automate examination processes, eliminate scheduling conflicts, ensure fair seat allocation, and provide quick results processing. The system facilitates secure question paper storage, randomized seat allocation to prevent cheating, and transparent result publication with revaluation request management.

The proposed system addresses challenges in manual examination management including scheduling errors, unfair seat allocation, slow result processing, and lack of result transparency. Key features include exam scheduling, seat allocation, question paper management, result entry and publication, and revaluation request handling. This report details the technical design, implementation approach, testing methodology, and future enhancements for the Examination Management System.

            $exam_time_end, $venue_id, $total_marks
        ])) {
            $exam_id = $pdo->lastInsertId();
            
            // Generate seat allocations

### Seat Allocation Algorithm

```php
function generateSeatAllocation($exam_id, $capacity_per_venue) {
    // Get students enrolled in this exam
    $studentSql = "SELECT DISTINCT sa.student_id 
                   FROM seat_allocation sa

    $stmt = $pdo->prepare($studentSql);
    $stmt->execute([$exam_id]);
    $students = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_COLUMN);
    
    // Shuffle students for randomness
    shuffle($students);
    
    // Allocate to seats sequentially
    $allocation = [];
    $seat_count = 0;
    $venue = 1;
    
    foreach ($students as $student_id) {
        $seat = ($seat_count % $capacity_per_venue) + 1;
        
        if ($seat == 1 && $seat_count > 0) {
            $venue++;
        }
        
        $allocation[] = [
            'student_id' => $student_id,
            'seat_number' => "ROOM{$venue}-SEAT{$seat}",
            'venue_id' => $venue
        ];
        
        $seat_count++;
    }
    
    return $allocation;
}
```

### Result Processing

```php
public function publishResults($exam_id, $pdo) {
    // Get all results for exam
    $sql = "SELECT er.result_id, er.student_id, er.marks_obtained 
            FROM exam_results er 
            WHERE er.exam_id = ? AND er.published = FALSE";
    
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare($sql);
    $stmt->execute([$exam_id]);
    $results = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    
    $updateSql = "UPDATE exam_results SET published = TRUE WHERE result_id = ?";
    $updateStmt = $pdo->prepare($updateSql);
    
    foreach ($results as $result) {
        // Send notification to student
        sendResultNotification($result['student_id'], $exam_id);
        
        // Mark as published
        $updateStmt->execute([$result['result_id']]);
    }
}
```

## CHAPTER 7: TESTING

### 7.1 Introduction to System Testing

System testing verifies:

1. No scheduling conflicts exist
2. Seats allocated fairly and randomly
3. Hall tickets generate correctly
4. Result entry prevents invalid marks
5. Results published to correct students
6. Revaluation requests processed properly

### 7.2 Types of Testing

#### Unit Testing
- Test scheduling conflict detection
- Test randomized seat allocation
- Test marks validation (0-100 range)
- Test revaluation status transitions

#### Integration Testing
- Exam creation → Seat allocation → Hall ticket generation
- Mark entry → Result calculation → Transcript update
- Revaluation request → Mark update → Transcript recalculation

#### Functional Testing
- Create exam for 200 students without conflicts
- Allocate seats and verify randomization
- Enter marks for all students
- Publish results and verify visibility to students
- Process revaluation requests

#### White Box Testing
- Verify shuffle algorithm for true randomization
- Test SQL conflict detection covers all scenarios
- Test transaction rollback on allocation failure

#### Black Box Testing
- User creates exam → System prevents conflicts
- User allocates seats → All students assigned
- User enters marks → Validation enforces limits
- Student views result → Information correct

#### Security Testing
- Non-admin cannot create exams
- Student cannot view other student results
- Faculty cannot modify published results without audit trail
- Question papers accessible only during exam time

#### Performance Testing
- Generate schedule for 1000+ students
- Allocate seats for 500+ students without lag
- Publish results for 1000+ students
- Generate hall tickets for 500+ students
