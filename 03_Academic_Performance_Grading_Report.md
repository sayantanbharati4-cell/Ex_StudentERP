## ABSTRACT

The Academic Performance & Grading System is a critical module of the Academic Monitoring System for Students, designed to assess, record, and analyze student academic performance across courses, semesters, and programs. This module provides a comprehensive platform for grade entry, GPA calculation, performance analytics, and academic standing determination.

The primary objective of this system is to automate grade management, eliminate manual calculation errors, and provide faculty, administrators, and students with transparent, real-time access to academic performance data. The system facilitates fair, consistent grade entry across multiple instructors and courses while generating insights for academic intervention and student support.

The proposed system addresses challenges in manual grading such as calculation errors in GPA, time-consuming grade processing, lack of performance transparency, and difficulty in identifying at-risk students. Key features include marks entry, grade calculation, GPA computation, performance analytics, and academic transcript generation. This report details the technical design, implementation approach, testing methodology, and future enhancements for the Academic Performance & Grading System.

## CHAPTER 3: ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Existing System

In the present scenario, academic performance management involves:

1. **Manual Mark Recording**: Faculty maintain hand-written mark sheets or spreadsheets with:
   - Risk of errors in transcription
   - Difficult calculations for GPA
   - No centralized repository
   - Inconsistent grading scales

2. **Fragmented Grade Storage**: Grades scattered across:
   - Faculty personal files
   - Department office records
   - Individual spreadsheets
   - Manual transcripts

### 3.2 Proposed System

The Academic Performance & Grading System proposes:

1. **Centralized Grade Management**: Single database for all grades across all courses and semesters.

2. **Automated Calculations**: Automatic grade conversion and GPA computation with configurable scales.

3. **Real-Time Access**: Students and parents view grades immediately after entry.

4. **Performance Analytics**: Dashboards showing performance trends and comparative analysis.

5. **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all grade entries and modifications.

### 3.3 Feasibility System

#### Economic Feasibility
- **Cost Savings**: Eliminates manual transcript preparation and reduces administrative time.
- **Efficiency Gains**: Grade processing and distribution much faster.
- **Verdict**: **FEASIBLE** – Economically viable for institution.

#### Technical Feasibility
- **Technology Stack**: PHP, MySQL proven for educational systems.
- **Integration**: Compatible with existing student and course management modules.
- **Verdict**: **FEASIBLE** – Technically sound implementation possible.

#### Operational Feasibility
- **User Training**: Faculty can be trained on marks entry quickly.
- **Adoption**: System improves transparency and reduces complaints.
- **Verdict**: **FEASIBLE** – Operationally implementable.

### 3.4 Software Specification

## CHAPTER 7: TESTING

### 7.1 Introduction to System Testing

System testing verifies:

1. Marks entered correctly and stored in database
2. Grades calculated accurately based on scale
3. GPA computations are mathematically correct
4. Academic standing determination works properly
5. Transcripts generated with correct information
6. System handles edge cases (failed students, borderline grades)

### 7.2 Types of Testing

#### Unit Testing
- Test grade calculation for all grade boundaries
- Test GPA calculation formula
- Test academic standing logic
- Test marks validation (0-100 range)

#### Integration Testing
- Marks entry → Grade calculation → GPA update → Transcript generation
- Mark modification → GPA recalculation
- Student performance view → Dashboard update

#### Functional Testing
- Enter marks for 50 students in a subject
- View individual student grades
- Generate academic transcript
- Export grades to CSV
- Access performance analytics

#### White Box Testing
- Test boundary conditions (90 marks for A+ threshold)
- Test GPA calculation with decimal places
- Test transaction handling for bulk updates
- Verify database constraints prevent invalid grades

#### Black Box Testing
- User enters marks → System calculates grade → Grade visible to student
- User generates transcript → PDF created with correct format
- User exports grades → CSV contains all data

#### Security Testing
- Non-faculty cannot enter grades
- Students cannot modify grades
- Grade modifications create audit logs
- Only authorized admins can approve marks

#### Performance Testing
- Enter marks for 500+ students simultaneously
- Generate transcript for student with 8 semesters of data
- Generate class performance report with 200+ students
- Chart rendering for performance analytics

## CHAPTER 8: CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE

### Conclusion

The Academic Performance & Grading System successfully automates grade management and provides transparent access to academic performance information. The system ensures fair, consistent grading while providing valuable insights for student support and institutional planning.

Key achievements:
- Automated grade calculation reducing manual errors
- Real-time performance transparency for students and parents
- Comprehensive analytics for identifying at-risk students
- Accurate, tamper-proof academic transcripts

### Future Scope

1. **Grade Prediction**: AI model to predict final grades based on mid-term performance
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Show student performance relative to class average
3. **Learning Path Recommendations**: Suggest courses based on academic strengths/weaknesses
4. **Mobile Grade Viewing**: App for students to view grades on mobile devices
5. **Parent Alerts**: Automated SMS/email when grades are uploaded
6. **Grade Appeals**: Online process for students to appeal grades
7. **Multiple Grade Scales**: Support different grading scales for different programs
8. **Weighted GPA**: Calculate GPA based on course credits
9. **Performance Prediction**: Predict graduation eligibility early
10. **Multi-Language Transcripts**: Generate transcripts in multiple languages
